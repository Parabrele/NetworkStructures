           title = {Generalised stochastic blockmodels and their applications in the analysis of brain networks},
            note = {Unpublished},
        abstract = {Recently, there has been a great interest in methods that can decompose brain networks into clusters with similar connection patterns. However, most of the currently used clustering methods in neuroimaging are based on the stringent assumption that the cluster structure is modular, that is, the nodes are densely connected within clusters, but sparsely connected between clusters. Furthermore, multi-subject network data is typically fit by several subject-by-subject analyses, which are limited by the fact that there is no obvious way to combine the results for group comparisons, or on a group-averaged network analysis, which does not reflect the variability between subjects. In the first part of this thesis, we consider the analysis of a single binary-valued brain network using the Stochastic Blockmodel (Daudin et al., 2008) and compare it to the widely used clustering methods, Louvain and Spectral algorithms. For this, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worm nervous system as a model organism whose wealth of prior biological knowledge can be used to validate the functional relevance of network decompositions. We show that the 'cores-in-modules' decomposition of the worm brain network estimated by the Stochastic Blockmodel is more compatible with prior biological knowledge about the C. elegans than the purely modular decompositions found by the Louvain and Spectral algorithms. In the second part of this thesis, we propose three multi-subject extensions of Daudin et al.'s Stochastic Blockmodel that can estimate a common cluster structure across subjects. Two of these (non-trivial) models use subject specific covariates to model variation in connection rates in the data. The first and trivial model assumes no variability between subjects, the second model accounts for a global variability in connections between subjects, and the third model accounts for local variability in connections between subjects that can differ across individual within/between-cluster connectivity elements. In the third part of this thesis, we propose a mixed-effect multi-subject model which can account for the repeated-measures aspects of multi-subject network data by including a random intercept. For the second and third part of the thesis, we use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the accuracy of the estimated parameters as well as the validity of inference procedures. Furthermore, we illustrate the proposed models on a resting state fMRI dataset with two groups of subjects: healthy volunteers and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Network studies of large-scale brain connectivity have begun to reveal attributes that promote the segregation and integration of neural information: communities and hubs. Network communities are sets of regions that are strongly interconnected among each other while connections between members of different communities are less dense. The clustered connectivity of network communities supports functional segregation and specialization. Network hubs link communities to one another and ensure efficient communication and information integration. This review surveys a number of recent reports on network communities and hubs, and their role in integrative processes. An emerging focus is the shifting balance between segregation and integration over time, which manifest in continuously changing patterns of functional interactions between regions, circuits and systems.}

Network analysis of human brain connectivity has consistently identified sets of regions that are critically important for enabling efficient neuronal signaling and communication. The central embedding of these candidate ‘brain hubs’ in anatomical networks supports their diverse functional roles across a broad range of cognitive tasks and widespread dynamic coupling within and across functional networks. The high level of centrality of brain hubs also renders them points of vulnerability that are susceptible to disconnection and dysfunction in brain disorders. Combining data from numerous empirical and computational studies, network approaches strongly suggest that brain hubs play important roles in information integration underpinning numerous aspects of complex cognitive function.}

This non-invasive tool enables us to study the basic and potentially complex network properties of the entire brain.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior, this study applies causal mediation analysis to pre-trained neural language models. We investigate the magnitude of models{'} preferences for grammatical inflections, as well as whether neurons process subject-verb agreement similarly across sentences with different syntactic structures. We uncover similarities and differences across architectures and model sizes{---}notably, that larger models do not necessarily learn stronger preferences. We also observe two distinct mechanisms for producing subject-verb agreement depending on the syntactic structure of the input sentence. Finally, we find that language models rely on similar sets of neurons when given sentences with similar syntactic structure.",
