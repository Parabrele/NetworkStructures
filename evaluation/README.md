# Evaluation

This directory contains functions to evaluate graphs. See `connectivity` folder for details on how they are built.

- `SBM.py` contains functions to fit SBMs to graphs for later study of the block structure.
- `faithfulness.py` contains functions to evaluate the faithfulness and completeness of a computational graph to it's original model. Faithfulness measures how well the graph represents the model - or how sufficient the graph is to explain the model - while completeness measures how necessary to the model is the graph.
